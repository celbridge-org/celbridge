# Getting Started

This project contains example folders that demonstrate the key features of Celbridge, including:

- Markdown documentation editing (example folder `01_markdown`)
- Embedded web applications (example folder `02_webapps`)
- Python scripting (example folder `03_python`)
- Spreadsheet editing, including importing data to a spreadsheet (example folder `04_data_import`), generating fake data for user test purposes (example folder `05_fake_data`), and data cleaning (example folder `06_data_cleaning`)

See the `readme.md` file in each example folder for more information.
