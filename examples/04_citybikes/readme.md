# Citybikes

This example demonstrates using a public REST API to download information and write it to a spreadsheet file.

1. Open **citybikes.webapp** to view the public bikes available in Dublin city. 
2. Click on a station to see how many bikes are available.
3. Right click on **citybikes.py** and select **Run** to run the script. The script downloads data from the public Citybikes REST API and saves it in the **citybikes.xlsx** Excel file.
4. Open **citybikes.xlsx** and check that the counts match the data presented in the webapp.
